# Fingerprint Management
A lab based on the following schema: [Fingerprint Recognition](http://www.databaseanswers.org/data_models/fingerprint_recognition/index.htm)

From the link above:
> The FBI (the US Federal Bureau of Investigation) maintains the world's largest Fingerprint Database, called IAFIS, which stands for "Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System". 
> 
> The FBI says :- 
> The IAFIS maintains the largest biometric database in the world, containing the fingerprints and corresponding criminal history information for more than 47 million subjects in the Criminal Master File. 
> The fingerprints and corresponding criminal history information are submitted voluntarily by state, local, and federal law enforcement agencies. 
> 
> Commercial Applications 
> The two Tables on the right of the Data Model show commercial applications of Biometrics and fingerprinting, where individuals can be tracked as they move through an environment or building with many fingerprinting scanning machines. 

Have a look at the rest of the [schemas](http://www.databaseanswers.org/data_models/) if you have some time!

## Deliverables
Fork this repository and deliver your work in the master branch.

## Instructions
Make liberal use of the [Active Record Query Interface Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html).

You should ONLY use Active Record query methods. No `each`, no `map`,
etc. 

Get all the tests to pass!

**NOTE**: This application uses Rails 3, so there may be some minor
differences in the ActiveRecord API!
